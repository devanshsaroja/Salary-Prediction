# Flask Salary Prediction

This project is a **machine learning web application** developed using **Flask** that predicts salaries based on a user's input of **date**, **month**, and **year**. The model is built using **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** and is trained on a **CSV file** containing historical salary data. The app processes the input through data cleaning and preprocessing steps, applies feature scaling using **StandardScaler**, and outputs a predicted salary.

## Features
- **Flask Web Application**: An interactive front-end where users can input their date of joining, month, and year to predict the salary.
- **Data Analysis & Cleaning**: The CSV data is cleaned and analyzed before being used for model training.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained using **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**, a popular machine learning algorithm.
- **Feature Scaling**: **StandardScaler** is applied to normalize the data for better performance of the model.
- **Pickle Serialization**: The trained model and scalers are saved as `.pkl` files for easy loading and prediction.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- Git (for version control)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-salary-prediction.git
   
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   After cloning the repository, go into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd flask-salary-prediction
   
3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**:

   - *For Windows*:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   - *For macOS/Linux*:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
4. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:

   - *On Windows*:
   ```bash
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   - *On macOS/Linux*:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   
5. **Install Required Dependencies**:

   Use pip to install all the required dependencies from the requirements.txt file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
6. **Run the Flask Application**:

   Finally, run the Flask development server by executing:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   This will start the application locally. You can now visit the application in your web browser at:
   ```bash
   Link

## How to Use the Application
1. Open the Web Browser: Open any browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and go to the Link
2. Input the Data:
   - Date: Enter the date (1 to 30).
   - Month: Enter the month (1 to 12).
   - Year: Enter the year (minimum 1952).
3. Click on 'Predict Salary': After filling out the form, click the "Predict Salary" button.
4. View the Prediction: The predicted salary will be displayed on the same page.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The project involves several data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure that the data fed into the machine learning model is clean, consistent, and ready for use. The following steps were performed:

1. Loading Data: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file using pandas.

2. Handling Missing Values: Any missing or null values in the dataset were handled by removing or imputing them as necessary.

3. Feature Engineering: We extracted meaningful features like date, month, and year for model training.

4. Normalization: The data is normalized using StandardScaler to ensure the features are scaled properly. This prevents any one feature from disproportionately influencing the model due to differences in scale.

5. Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance effectively.

## Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model used in this project is Support Vector Regression (SVR), which is particularly effective in predicting continuous values like salary.

# Model Details:
- SVR was chosen because it can handle non-linear relationships and perform well even with limited data.
- StandardScaler was applied to both the features (date, month, year) and the target variable (salary) to improve model performance.
- The trained model is serialized using Pickle to allow easy loading during prediction.

## Files in this Repository
- app.py: The main Flask application file that runs the web server.
- model.pkl: The pickled pre-trained SVR model.
- scaler_X.pkl: The pickled scaler for input features.
- scaler_y.pkl: The pickled scaler for the target variable.
- requirements.txt: Lists all the dependencies required to run the project.
- templates/: Contains HTML files for the front-end of the application.
- index.html: The HTML form for inputting data and displaying predictions.

## Example of Prediction
Once the user inputs the date, month, and year, the application will return a predicted salary, like this:
```bash
The predicted salary is: $60,000.00
```
